The cofounder leveraged a unique confluence of emergent genetic engineering, internet culture, and strong associations with the music industry, to be one of the first companies to establish an identity and streetwear company that has come to dominate the industry.\n","Today, Cookies is one of the most respected and top-selling cannabis brands in California and is globally recognized, amassing a stable of over 50 cannabis varieties and product lines including indoor, outdoor and sungrown flower, pre-rolls, gel caps and vape carts. With two flagship Cookies stores in Los Angeles on Melrose and Maywood and a third location in Redding, Cookies' overall vertical integration and seed to sale business allows for complete quality control at every step from cultivation and production to retail experience.\n","In 2015, the brand's hip-hop credibility effortlessly expanded Cookies into streetwear and today offers a range of products for both men and women in the apparel and accessories categories as well as a curated selection of smoking supplies."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"qrO0SjpiEc7z"},"source":["## Challenge:\n","You and your partner (yes you will be allowed to work in groups of up to 2!), will serve as consultants to Cookies. Having been provided with a complete set of cannabis sales data going back to 2018, along with detailed product descriptions for all brands sold in California, you will be asked to:\n","1. Develop a predictive model to help forecast product sales\n","2. Conduct an analysis to determine the key factors that likely impact the success of a product\n","and based on the data analysis propose potential growth areas to the company\n","This project will include both a structured component, where much like Projects 1 and 2, you will be given a specific set of instructions to complete. There will also be an unstructured component where we will ask you to experiment with your own approaches to see if you can maximize your own results."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"j4aMGA3tFP5h"},"source":["## Project Requirements:  "]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"UOvzX0IaFPq0"},"source":["## Specific Coding Requirements:\n","1. **Merge Datasets and Effectively Link information** - Useful information for this project will come from disparate datasets. You will need to effectively merge them into a single dataframe for analysis\n","2. **Develop basic Time Series Feature Extraction Plan** - develop a series of standard timeseries\n","features to augment your dataset and enable timeseries predictive models.\n","3. **Run some basic statistics on your variables including correlations with labels and report\n","findings** - Particularly once you employ PCA and other ‘black box’ methods, the descriptive power of any of your features will effectively disappear. Still you want to report out meaningful correlations toCookies to help them flag key indicators they can employ (this step will also be helpful for you in flagging potential co-linearities).\n","4. **Create additional data feature extraction plan and implement a comprehensive pipeline to execute it** - Determine and execute a plan to process your data for modeling and then implement a pipeline to execute it. Specifically:\n","    1. Determine which fields to retain and which to drop.\n","    2. For those you retain, determine a categorization strategy\n","    3. Determine an imputation strategy (you should choose more than one imputation\n","    method depending on the specifics of your data\n","    4. Augment at least one feature, ideally a feature cross, or non-linear transition e. Determine a strategy for scaling features\n","5. **Implement a single pipeline to execute this transformation**\n","6. **Document your data strategy in your report. Provide an explanation or justification for why\n","you chose the data you did, and also detail any experiments you ran and the results**\n","7. **Implement a basic Linear Regression predictive model** - With your newly pipelined data find\n","and interpret important features (e.g. using regression and associated p-values). If there are any\n","collinearities be careful when incorporating them into the regression.\n","8. **Implement Principle Component Analysis (PCA)** - Since your resulting dataframe is likely to be\n","high-dimensionality, employ PCA to reduce the complexity of your dataframe\n","9. **Employ an ensemble method to your predictive model exercise** - Leverage an ensemble\n","learning method to generate an optimized prediction model\n","10. **Cross-Validate your training results** - Employ K-Fold Cross-validation to your training regimen\n","for both ensemble and single regression models. (Optional: employ a stratifiedshufflesplit as\n","well to ensure equitable distribution along a key parameter)\n","11. **Employ a GridSearch method to optimize your parameters** - Leverage gridsearch or an\n","equivalent parameter tuning approach to optimize parameters to your predictive model (Note:\n","you can likely merge the gridsearch and cross-validation steps)\n","12. **Experiment with your own custom models and report out your highest performing model** -\n","For this part of the project you have free range to employ any of the tools you’ve learned in class, along with any additional tools or techniques you research independently to see how you can do."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"NO9R9dIOFVHW"},"source":["### Loading Essential Functions"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"k82aQT8-FbWy","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1638678574856,"user_tz":480,"elapsed":100,"user":{"displayName":"Lea Alcantara","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14Gi6qlzNz4OrvvL4pJaYI67y-hQyDhK0y3rB96TQ=s64","userId":"06478310135260083843"}},"outputId":"6f7f6a89-9a46-4d5f-838a-6b9298c63cdd"},"source":["import numpy as np \n","import pandas as pd \n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt \n","\n","import seaborn as sns # used for plot interactive graph.\n","from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, cross_val_score, GridSearchCV\n","from sklearn import metrics\n","from sklearn.svm import SVC  \n","import statsmodels.api as sm \n","from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\n","from sklearn.cluster import KMeans\n","from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix\n","import sklearn.metrics.cluster as smc\n","from matplotlib import pyplot\n","\n","import os\n","import itertools\n","import random \n","\n","%matplotlib inline\n","\n","random.seed(148)\n","\n","#Mount Google Drive\n","from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive')\n","\n","GOOGLE_DRIVE_PATH = \"/content/drive/MyDrive/\"\n","DATA_PATH = GOOGLE_DRIVE_PATH + 'CS148_Final_Project/Raw_Data/'"],"execution_count":332,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Drive already mounted at /content/drive; to attempt to forcibly remount, call drive.mount(\"/content/drive\", force_remount=True).\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"EgERK0epFfes"},"source":["# Goal 1: Develop Predictive Model to Predict Sales\n","Using **Time-Series Analysis**, use Monthly data to predict sales for future months.\n","\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"_7J5K3TJxhQ0"},"source":["## Coding Requirement 1: Data Merging"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"Bfw-0KJEFogf","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1638678575983,"user_tz":480,"elapsed":950,"user":{"displayName":"Lea Alcantara","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14Gi6qlzNz4OrvvL4pJaYI67y-hQyDhK0y3rB96TQ=s64","userId":"06478310135260083843"}}},"source":["#Import all four datasets\n","price = pd.read_csv(DATA_PATH + 'BrandAverageRetailPrice.csv')\n","sales = pd.read_csv(DATA_PATH + 'BrandTotalSales.csv')\n","units = pd.read_csv(DATA_PATH + 'BrandTotalUnits.csv')\n","details = pd.read_csv(DATA_PATH + 'BrandDetails.csv')\n","top_50 = pd.read_csv(DATA_PATH + 'Top50ProductsbyTotalSales-Timeseries.csv')"],"execution_count":333,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"X-pYUiNbysY8","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1638678575984,"user_tz":480,"elapsed":6,"user":{"displayName":"Lea Alcantara","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14Gi6qlzNz4OrvvL4pJaYI67y-hQyDhK0y3rB96TQ=s64","userId":"06478310135260083843"}}},"source":["#Filter the datasets on just the Brand 'Cookies' --> We determined that focusing on just Cookies does not provide enough information to get an accurate model\n","sales_cookie = sales.loc[sales['Brand'] == 'Cookies']\n","units_cookie = units.loc[units['Brands'] == 'Cookies']\n","price_cookie = price.loc[price['Brands'] == 'Cookies']"],"execution_count":334,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"Ag-OnmqfxtsB","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1638678576166,"user_tz":480,"elapsed":186,"user":{"displayName":"Lea Alcantara","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14Gi6qlzNz4OrvvL4pJaYI67y-hQyDhK0y3rB96TQ=s64","userId":"06478310135260083843"}}},"source":["#Merge together the sales, units, and price datasets\n","merge1 = sales.merge(units, left_on= ['Months','Brand'], right_on=['Months', 'Brands'])\n","merge2 = merge1.merge(price, on=['Months','Brands'])\n","\n","#Ended up determining that we no longer need this dataset.
